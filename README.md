# SecAct: Secreted Protein Activity Inference <img src="man/figures/sticker.png" align="right" alt="" width="120" />


SecAct is an R package desighed for inferring the intercellular activity
of secreted proteins in tumors from gene expression profiles. Users can
input multiple modalities of expression data, including bulk,
single-cell, or spatial transcriptomics. The outputs are 1248 secreted
protein activities for each sample, individual cell, or ST spot,
respectively. SecAct achieves this by leveraging intercellular
signatures trained from 618 genome-wide spatial transcriptomics profiles
across 28 tumor types. If the input are spatial transcriptomics, SecAct
additionally calculates the signaling velocities of secreted proteins
from source to sink spots.
